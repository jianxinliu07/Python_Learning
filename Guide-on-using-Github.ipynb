    "Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots."

    "### Getting a Git Repository\n",
    "You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or\n",
    "\n",
    "You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory\n",
    "If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project’s directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "for Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ cd /c/user/my_project\n",
    "\n",
    "and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git init\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. (See Git Internals for more information about exactly what files are contained in the .git directory you just created.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few git add commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a git commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git add *.c\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git add LICENSE\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git commit -m 'initial project version'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cloning an Existing Repository\n",
    "If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you’d like to contribute to — the command you need is git clone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You clone a repository with git clone <url>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2\n",
    "\n",
    "That creates a directory named libgit2, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new libgit2 directory that was just created, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than libgit2, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit\n",
    "\n",
    "That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called mylibgit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the https:// protocol, but you may also see git:// or user@server:path/to/repo.git, which uses the SSH transfer protocol. Getting Git on a Server will introduce all of the available options the server can set up to access your Git repository and the pros and cons of each."
